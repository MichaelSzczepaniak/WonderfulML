Machine Learning Toolbox
------------------------

This project consolidates the tools I've developed to do machine
learning. Most if not all of these tools are available in various
packages/libraries in R or Python, but were developed because I learn
algorithms, approaches and various types of analysis best when I first
implement them myself from scratch. The code in this project is
referenced throughout various projects in my repo.

### Project Breakdown

The project is broken down into \[TBD\] parts described below. Each part
corresponds to a folder in this project which contains additional
documentation describing the most important details regarding that
particular section. Each part contains a link to a web page which
describes that part in further detail.
