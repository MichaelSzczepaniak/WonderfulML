## The Wonderful World of Machine Learning
This is the home for the sessions content for the series on Machine Learning lead by Michael Szczepaniak

### [The first session was June 29, 2017](https://www.meetup.com/Fort-Collins-Data-Science/events/240483138/)
### [Sondra's ML overview, session 1.5, was July 6, 2017](https://www.meetup.com/Fort-Collins-Data-Science/events/240982515/)
### [The second session, Linear Regression - Extreme Interpretability, was July 13, 2017](https://www.meetup.com/Fort-Collins-Data-Science/events/241236268/)

Future session are tentatively schedule for:

- 7/20 session 3 - Logistic Regression: Binary Classifier Workhorse
- 7/27 session 4 - Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA & QDA)  
- 8/03 session 5 - Trees  
- 8/10 session 6 - Neural Nets 
- 8/24 session 7 - Support Vector Machines (???)

### Proposed Agenda

The first half hour of every session is slated for review of fundamentals that will support the understanding of the algorithm(s) we'll be focusing on for next weeks assignment. If folks are good on the basics, we'll expand this time into the second half hour.

The second half hour is slated for working through the current assignment which was assigned in the prior session. The last half hour will cover the material for the sessions main topic and a go over a quick description of the assignment due for the next session.

If anyone would like to volunteer to do a review fundamentals presentation in the first half hour, please let me know so we can coordinate you presentation.

I'm going to try to work in concepts such as how to train models with boostrap methods like bagging, random forest and boosting as well as how the main cross-validation techniques work, but we may not have enough time to do much with these areas. Let me know your thoughts on how how these sessions might be more beneficial to you!
