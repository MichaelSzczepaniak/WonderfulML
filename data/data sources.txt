description: original dataset of handwritten digits taken from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ put into a python pickle for easy consumption.

The pickled file represents a tuple of 3 lists : the training set, the validation set and the testing set. Each of the three lists is a pair formed from a list of images and a list of class labels for each of the images. An image is represented as numpy 1-dimensional array of 784 (28 x 28) float values between 0 and 1 (0 stands for black, 1 for white). The labels are numbers between 0 and 9 indicating which digit the image represents.
